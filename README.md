# NASA Exoplanet Project

## Overview
The **NASA Exoplanet Project** is an initiative to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from data about exoplanets discovered by NASA missions. This project utilizes modern tools and programming techniques to process large datasets, identify patterns, and present findings in an accessible format.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Processes exoplanet data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates visualizations to highlight key trends and patterns.
- **Custom Metrics**: Implements algorithms to calculate metrics like habitability scores.
- **Extensibility**: Modular codebase to allow for easy expansion of features.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zach-Maestas/nasa-exoplanet-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nasa-exoplanet-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by placing it in the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/`).
2. Run the main script to process and analyze data:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. View generated outputs in the `results/` or `visualizations/` folder.

## File Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains datasets used in the project.
- **`src/`**: Core logic for data processing and analysis.
- **`visualizations/`**: Stores generated charts and plots.
- **`results/`**: Outputs of data processing.
- **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the project.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies.
